## Description

NaturalArmors is a small Minecraft mod that introduces 9 new armor sets, crafted from woods and fruits! These new armor sets all have the same properties as leather armor, which makes them useful without being overpowered. Besides being useful as early-game armor, these sets are also great for camouflaging yourself from your enemies, or simply for making yourself look fabulous.

These new armor sets can be crafted and repaired just like the existing armor sets. To craft a piece of oak armor, you will need to use oak logs, to craft a piece of spruce armor, you will need spruce logs, and so forth. Similarly, to repair a piece of oak armor, you will need to use oak logs, et cetera.
